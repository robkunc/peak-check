This project is being built in phases according to the detailed specification in `sierra-conditions-spec.md`.

### What's Working Now

- ✅ Next.js 15 with TypeScript and App Router
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- ✅ NextAuth authentication (email magic link + optional Google OAuth)
- ✅ Role-based access control (Leader/Admin)
- ✅ Complete API routes for peaks, conditions, notes, and sources
- ✅ Peaks list page with region grouping
- ✅ Individual peak conditions pages with weather, land status, road status, and notes
- ✅ Manual notes system with pagination, edit, and delete
- ✅ NOAA weather integration with automatic station selection
- ✅ Firecrawl integration for scraping land manager and road status pages
- ✅ Full admin interface for managing peaks and data sources
- ✅ Background jobs for refreshing weather, land status, and road status data
- ✅ Manual refresh triggers in admin interface

### Coming Next

- 🚧 Phase 6: Optional enhancements (rule-based hints, notifications, etc.)
- 🚧 Set up automated cron jobs for data refresh
- 🚧 Production deployment and testing

## 🚀 Quick Start

- **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** - Complete setup and deployment guide
- **[IMPORT-GUIDE.md](./IMPORT-GUIDE.md)** - Guide for importing peaks and configuring data sources
- **[sierra-conditions-spec.md](./sierra-conditions-spec.md)** - Full technical specification and architecture

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## 📝 Key Features

### For Leaders
- Browse all peaks organized by region
- View aggregated conditions per peak (weather, land status, road status)
- Add and view trip reports and field observations
- Simple, accessible interface with large text and high contrast

### For Admins
- Full CRUD operations on peaks catalog
- Configure data sources (land manager URLs, road status URLs)
- Manage user roles (via Prisma Studio for now)
- View data refresh status

## 🔐 Security

- Authentication required for all peak data
- Role-based access control (Leader vs Admin)
- API routes protected with NextAuth session validation
- Soft deletes for peaks (preserves data integrity)

## 📊 Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive schema with:
- Users (with roles)
- Peaks (with GPS coordinates)
- Peak Sources (configured URLs for data scraping)
- Weather Snapshots
- Land Status Snapshots
- Road Status Snapshots
- Manual Notes

See `prisma/schema.prisma` for the complete schema.

## 🧪 Development

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run build

# Linting
npm run lint

# Database tools
npm run db:push    # Push schema changes
npm run db:studio  # Open Prisma Studio GUI
```

## 📦 Deployment

Designed for Vercel deployment:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy!

For cron jobs (weather/status refresh), use Vercel Cron or an external service.
