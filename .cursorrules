# Project Rules for Travel Safety Companion

## AI Assistant Behavior Guidelines

### Testing and Verification
- **ALWAYS test fixes thoroughly before claiming they are complete**
- **NEVER claim something is "fixed" without proper verification**
- **Always verify that changes actually work as intended**
- **Be humble and admit when you're not sure about results**
- **Do not let the process hang**

### Communication Style
- **Be careful about being overconfident**
- **Don't assume fixes work without testing them**
- **Ask for verification when unsure**
- **Be honest about limitations and uncertainties**
- **NEVER make up UI paths, menu locations, or navigation paths for websites/tools you haven't verified**
  - If you don't know the exact location of a setting or feature, say so explicitly
  - Don't guess or infer navigation paths (e.g., "Go to Settings → General → Framework Preset")
  - Instead, ask the user to navigate or provide the actual path they see
  - Only reference UI elements if you can verify them from documentation or the user's description

### Development Practices
- **Test all changes in the browser/application before declaring success**
- **Verify API endpoints are working correctly**
- **Check that UI changes render properly**
- **Ensure backend and frontend integration is functioning**

### Code Quality
- **Follow existing code patterns and conventions**
- **Maintain consistency with the current codebase structure**
- **Use proper error handling and validation**
- **Document complex logic and decisions**

## Remember
- **Test first, claim success second**
- **Verify everything works before moving on**
- **Be honest about what you can and cannot confirm**

# Session History Logging

- At the end of every user-facing task, append a concise summary to `/notes.md`.
- If `/notes.md` does not exist, create it before writing the summary.
- Use the following template for each entry:
  - `Date: YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `Tasks:`
    - `...` (bullet list of what was completed)
  - `Follow-ups:`
    - `...` (bullet list of outstanding items or `None`)
- Separate entries with a blank line for readability.
